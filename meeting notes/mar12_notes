potential explainers
- soil fertility
- invasion
- mean annual
- richeness and total cover were informative



- usda plants api - vs unknowns
 - usda plants can also grab functional groups
- more site-level stuff

Main Q at this point
why NERR relationships positive vs negative?
site level by default


incorporate exotic legacy?
maybe exotic dominance is a proxy of time since invasion
calculate total native cover and total invasive cover
e.g. what is the most dominant exotic species or two, and what their relative cover
also prevalence (how many plots is it at)
