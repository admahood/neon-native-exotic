MEETING NOTES

Adam individual work 6/25/2021 =================================================

downloaded prism climate data (although probably better to use the direct measurements from neon)
downloaded global aridity index

did some data exploration on why some 1m things have negative vs positive coefficients.
created poisson glms for each site at the 1m level, made a table of coefficients,
then joined that to the ancillary data and made some plots 
(draft_figures/coefficient_explore.png)

script is "extract_ancillary data.R"

takeaway? nothing strong, seems like many of the plots with negative coefficients
i.e. evidence of biotic resistance at 1m, have: low AI, low elevation, 
low precip, low slope.... again, nothing strong, just another initial look.

maybe think about what variables would indicate environmental heterogeneity at small scales

another thought - maybe plot unknown %, see if that's having a big effect
anothe rhtought - maybe assume all unknowns are native and see what that does
another thought - write an article about how there's too many unknown species
                  in the neon database for it to be of any use lol
MARCH 12 2021 ==================================================================

potential explainers
- soil fertility
- invasion
- mean annual precip/temp/etc
- richeness and total cover were informative

- usda plants api - vs unknowns
 - usda plants can also grab functional groups
- more site-level stuff

Main Q at this point
why NERR relationships positive vs negative?
site level by default


incorporate exotic legacy?
maybe exotic dominance is a proxy of time since invasion
calculate total native cover and total invasive cover
e.g. what is the most dominant exotic species or two, and what their relative cover
also prevalence (how many plots is it at)
